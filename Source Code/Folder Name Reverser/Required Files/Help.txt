Folder Name Reverser renames all the folders within a specified folder by reversing the tokens contained in the name. So for example: "Folder Name Reverser" will now become "Reverser Name Folder". Note that the folder parsing is not recursive in nature.

To start the operation, simply click on the Begin button. 

The help and about menu options brings up the help and about dialog boxes respectively.
